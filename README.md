# Lead up API Documentation

To utilize the data available in the database, I developed an API through which both the web page and the mobile application can GET, POST, UPDATE, and DELETE information such as user data, company details, deliveries, and employee records.

The API is developed using pure JavaScript, leveraging npm packages such as axios, bcrypt, compression, connect-mongo, cors, express, mongoose, googlemaps, passport, and others.

## Getting started

To retrieve all the required npm packages, you need to run the following command in your terminal:
```
npm install
```


Now that you have the packages installed, it's time to understand where the data is being saved and how to establish a connection between the API and the database. Then, we'll explore all the endpoints and the authentication process.
